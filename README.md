🧭 Step-by-Step: Upload index.html to GitHub
1. Go to GitHub
Visit https://github.com and log in.
2. Create a New Repository
Click the “+” icon in the top right → New repository.
Name it something like safety-device-form.
Choose Public.
Click Create repository.
3. Upload Your File
In your new repository, click “Add file” > “Upload files”.
Drag and drop your index.html file into the upload area.
Scroll down and click “Commit changes”.
🌐 Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages
Go to the Settings tab of your repository.
Scroll down to Pages (or search “Pages” in the sidebar).
Under Source, select:
Branch: main
Folder: / (root)
Click Save.
GitHub will generate a link like:

https://yourusername.github.io/safety-device-form/
✅ Step 5: Visit Your Form
Wait 1–5 minutes for GitHub to publish the page.
Visit the link to see your live form.
Would you like help customizing the form further or adding a way to save responses (e.g., using Google Sheets or GitHub backend)?

To save responses from your GitHub Pages HTML form to Google Sheets, you’ll need to use a service like Google Apps Script to act as a backend. Here's a step-by-step guide to set it up:

✅ Step-by-Step: Save Form Responses to Google Sheets
1. Create a Google Sheet
Go to Google Sheets.
Create a new sheet and name it (e.g., Safety Device Responses).
Add column headers like:
Device Name
Applicability
Inspection Criteria
Compliance References
Timestamp
2. Set Up Google Apps Script
In your Google Sheet, click Extensions > Apps Script.
Delete any code and paste this:

Click Deploy > Test deployments > Web app.
Set:
Execute as: Me
Who has access: Anyone
Click Deploy and copy the Web App URL.
3. Update Your HTML Form
In your index.html, update the form to send data to the Google Apps Script URL:


Replace "YOUR_WEB_APP_URL" with the URL from your Apps Script deployment.

Would you like me to generate a complete version of the HTML form with this integration included?

404
File not found

The site configured at this address does not contain the requested file.

If this is your site, make sure that the filename case matches the URL as well as any file permissions.
For root URLs (like http://example.com/) you must provide an index.html file.

The 404 error you're seeing means GitHub Pages couldn't find the index.html file at the root of your repository. Here's how to fix it:

✅ Fix GitHub Pages 404 Error
1. Ensure the File is Named Correctly
The file must be named index.html (all lowercase).
GitHub Pages looks for this file at the root of your repository.
2. Upload the File to the Root Directory
Go to your repository on GitHub.
Click “Add file” > “Upload files”.
Upload your index.html file directly — not inside a folder.
Click “Commit changes”.
3. Enable GitHub Pages
Go to Settings > Pages.
Under Source, select:
Branch: main
Folder: / (root)
Click Save.
4. Wait and Refresh
GitHub may take a few minutes to publish the page.
Visit the URL shown in the Pages section, like:
https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/
Would you like me to regenerate the full index.html content again so you can copy and paste it directly into your file?

Thanks for confirming the file name is index.html. Since you're still seeing a 404 error, here are the most common reasons and how to fix them:

🔍 Troubleshooting GitHub Pages 404 Error
✅ 1. Check File Location
Make sure index.html is in the root directory of your repository.
It should not be inside a folder like /docs or /files.
✅ 2. Check GitHub Pages Settings
Go to your repository → Settings → Pages.
Under Source, make sure:
Branch is set to main.
Folder is set to / (root).
Click Save if you haven’t already.
✅ 3. Wait a Few Minutes
GitHub Pages can take 1–5 minutes to publish changes.
Refresh the page after a short wait.
✅ 4. Check the URL
The URL should look like:
https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/
Make sure:
Your GitHub username is correct.
The repository name matches exactly.
The URL is case-sensitive.
